# Spectral-Clustering

Abstract:

Spectral clustering is an important method of cluster analysis based on the spectral the-ory of matrices. In this thesis we deal with the relations of spectral clustering to severalmathematical areas, for example to graph theory, perturbation theory and Markov chains.We prove the Rayleigh-Ritz theorem, which is important not only for the spectral clus-tering method, but can also be used in the method of principal component analysis andother methods that use eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Furthermore, in this thesis we dealwith spectral clustering from the point of view of applications, where we present expe-rimental results on non-trivial real data, and we also discuss the appropriate setting ofhyperparameters.
